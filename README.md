Tales of the Arabian Nights (2009) Board Game Lookup Translator

This is the source code of the Android app originally created by BGG user bodaster. It's used to streamline encounters in Tales of the Arabian Nights. I've recently rebuilt the app from the original source to work with newer revisions of Android. See https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3471238/tales-of-the-arabian-nights-app-redux-android-only for the BGG thread. I reached out to bodaster and was answered by his wife informing me of his passing and giving me permission to publish the code.

The only functional change I made was to display all three encounter possibilities when a skill is mastered.
